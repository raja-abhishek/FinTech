# FinTech Case Study: Klarna
## Overview and origin
Klarna Bank AB, commonly known as Klarna, is a Swedish fintech company that provides online financial services such as point of sale financing, payments for online storefronts and direct payments along with post-purchase payments.

Klarna was founded in 2005 by three friends from the Stockholm School of Economics; Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson.

There is an interesting coincidence which led to the foundation of Klarna. In 2003 two founders of Klarna Sebastian and Niklas decided to take a trip around the world without flying. They missed the ship from Australia and due to that Sebastian wasn’t back in Stockholm in time for the exam he had to pass in order to be allowed to continue his studies at the Stockholm School of Economics. Missing an exam can seem like a minor event, but for Sebastian it meant he had to work for a year before he could continue his studies at the Stockholm School of Economics.

“Sebastian had difficulties getting a job, but he finally landed one as a telephone marketer at a financial company. It was at that company he came into contact with e-commerce companies saying ‘we would really like help selling safely and simply on the internet, so if you could stand surety we would like to do business with you'. Sebastian presented this problem to Niklas and Victor which ultimately led to the idea to make ecommerce easier and safer for retailers and shoppers. With this idea they participated in the Stockholm School of Economics annual entrepreneurship award in 2005, however their idea did not receive enthusiasm and their entry was among the last in the competition. Despite this, they decided to found Klarna in mid-2005 and started operations in Sweden.

## Funding
An angel investor, Jane Walerud was the first investor and since then Klarna has received $3.2 billion in funding from various investors including Sequoia group, BlackRock, Ant Capital, Soft Bank, Common Wealth Bank of Australia.

## Business Activities:

Klarna’s business model is to simplify payments for both merchants and consumers. Klarna offers a better shopping experience by removing obstacles in the checkout and requires only top of mind information, no lengthy registration process or credit card numbers are needed to complete the purchase. Consumers are offered to shop with three intuitive payment methods; Pay Now, Pay Later and Slice It, giving flexibility in payments with a variety of pay after delivery options and installment plans to the consumer who also gets safeguarded by Klarna’s buyers protection. Klarna assumes all the risk for both the consumer and merchant.

Klarna's primary customer target is merchants. The company's target merchant is in the segment where the order value is comparatively low because its key offering is the split into 4. Fashion is Klarna's big target market. Klarna partners with large retailers with well-known brands exclusively to scale customer acquisition. Large players featuring in Klarna's collateral are Macy's, Lululemon, and Sephora. Klarna's competitive advantage depends on its simple and smooth payment process that needs minimal customer details, making more regular and consistent purchases possible.

## Landscape:

Klarna competes in payment and point of sale financing domain. Point of sale financing is projected to continue its growth from 7 percent of US unsecured lending balances in 2019 to about 13 to 15 percent of balances by 2023, according to data from McKinsey’s Consumer Lending Pools. This is the only unsecured-lending asset class that has experienced high-double-digit growth through the COVID-19 crisis. The growth is underpinned by increased consumer and merchant awareness and adoption of point-of-sale financing solutions.

Innovation is playing a major role in fueling the grwoth in this domain. These innovations are:

- Use of biometric and digital identity
- Real time clearing and settlements
- Touch less payment
- Instatnt credit approval
 
However expected grwoth is creating a tough competition and many players have entered in this domain. Some major players in this domain are:

  - Paypal
  - Stripe
  - Shopify Pay Installments
  - Amazon Pay
  - Braintree
  - Stripe Checkout
  - Afterpay
  - Authorize.net
  - Square Payments
  - Vanco Payment Solutions
  - LawPay
  - Sezzle

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Klarna's target is the segment where the order value is comparatively low (such as Fashion, Grocery etc.) which means they are operating in low margin segments. Currently a significant portion of Klarna revenue comes from a flat fee of $0.30 and a variable percentage fee between 3.29% to 5.99% charged to merchants. Any financial and non financial risk (such as increase in default, data breach etc.) will further reduce their margin. Klarna should look to 

- Enhance their product offering
  - Offer payment solutions for high value items (auto, High end electronics) and charge interest
  - Offer payment solution between merchant and supplier 
- Improve risk management capability to manage the risk better. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
- Enhanced product offering will 
  - improve their margin and ultimately the bottom line 
  - will help them expand further in different areas
  - will help merchants in managing their financials end to end which will further improve customer satisfcation
