# FinTech Case Study: Klarna
## Overview and origin
---------------------------------------
Klarna Bank AB, commonly known as Klarna, is a ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ (BNPL) service that allows online shoppers to pay for products later in the month or in instalments at no extra cost. 

The three founders Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson participated in a “Shark tank”-style pitch competition at the Stockholm School of Economics with the King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, H&M’s chairman Stefan Persson, and other prominent business leaders in attendance. However, the pitch of “Buy now, pay later” online was not popular with the jury and they ended up last. But one man came up to Sebastian after the presentation and encouraged him to follow through with the idea saying that "the banks will never do it". Shaken but still believing there was something in their idea, they decided to found Klarna in 2005 and started operations in Sweden
