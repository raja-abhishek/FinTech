# FinTech Case Study: Klarna
## Overview and origin
Klarna Bank AB, commonly known as Klarna, is a Swedish fintech company that provides online financial services such as point of sale financing, payments for online storefronts and direct payments along with post-purchase payments.

Klarna was founded in 2005 by three friends from the Stockholm School of Economics; Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson.

There is an interesting coincidence which led to the foundation of Klarna. In 2003 two founders of Klarna Sebastian and Niklas decided to take a trip around the world without flying. They missed the ship from Australia and due to that Sebastian wasn’t back in Stockholm in time for the exam he had to pass in order to be allowed to continue his studies at the Stockholm School of Economics. Missing an exam can seem like a minor event, but for Sebastian it meant he had to work for a year before he could continue his studies at the Stockholm School of Economics.

“Sebastian had difficulties getting a job, but he finally landed one as a telephone marketer at a financial company. It was at that company he came into contact with e-commerce companies saying ‘we would really like help selling safely and simply on the internet, so if you could stand surety we would like to do business with you'. Sebastian presented this problem to Niklas and Victor which ultimately led to the idea to make ecommerce easier and safer for retailers and shoppers. With this idea they participated in the Stockholm School of Economics annual entrepreneurship award in 2005, however their idea did not receive enthusiasm and their entry was among the last in the competition. Despite this, they decided to found Klarna in mid-2005 and started operations in Sweden.

## Funding

Consumers are offered to shop with three intuitive payment methods; Pay Now, Pay Later and Slice It, giving flexibility in payments with a variety of pay after delivery options and installment plans to the consumer who also gets safeguarded by Klarna’s buyers protection. Klarna assumes all the risk for both the consumer and merchant.

## Recommendations

Klarna's target is the segment where the order value is comparatively low (such as Fashion, Grocery etc.) which means they are operating in low margin segments. Currently a significant portion of Klarna revenue comes from a flat fee of $0.30 and a variable percentage fee between 3.29% to 5.99% charged to merchants. Any financial and non financial risk (such as increase in default, data breach etc.) will further reduce their margin. Klarna should look to 

- Enhance their product offering
  - Offer payment solutions for high value items (auto, High end electronics) and charge interest
  - Offer payment solution between merchant and supplier 
- Improve risk management capability to manage the risk better. 

- Enhanced product offering will 
  - improve their margin and ultimately the bottom line 
  - will help them expand further in different areas
  - will help merchants in managing their financials end to end which will further improve customer satisfcation
- Improved risk managment capability will
  - will reduce default risk, hence improved margin
  - will help mitigating online security threat which will reduce possibility of lawsuits, fines and reputational damage
 
Klarna has required technology to roll out enhanced product offering and to manage risk. They can include blockchain in their existing technology suites which will help in enhancing the security of data related to customers, merchants and transcations.
