# FinTech Case Study: Klarna
## Overview and origin
Klarna Bank AB, commonly known as Klarna, is a ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ (BNPL) service that allows online shoppers to pay for products later in the month or in instalments at no extra cost. 

Klarna was founded in 2005 by three friends from the Stockholm School of Economics; Sebastian Siemiatkowski, Niklas Adalberth and Victor Jacobsson. There is an interesting coincidence which led to the foundation of Klarna. 

In 2003 two founders of Klarna Sebastian and Niklas decided to take a trip around the world without flying. They missed the ship from Australia and due to that Sebastian wasn’t back in Stockholm in time for the exam he had to pass in order to be allowed to continue his studies at the Stockholm School of Economics. Missing an exam can seem like a minor event, but for Sebastian it meant he had to work for a year before he could continue his studies at the Stockholm School of Economics.

“Sebastian had difficulties getting a job, but he finally landed one as a telephone marketer at a financial company. It was at that company he came into contact with e-commerce companies saying ‘we would really like help selling safely and simply on the internet, so if you could stand surety we would like to do business with you'. Sebastian presented this problem to Niklas and Victor which ultimately led to the idea to make ecommerce easier and safer for retailers and shoppers. With this idea they participated in the Stockholm School of Economics annual entrepreneurship award in 2005, however their idea did not receive enthusiasm and their entry was among the last in the competition. Despite this, they decided to found Klarna in mid-2005 and started operations in Sweden.

## Funding
An angel investor, Jane Walerud was the first investor and since then Klarna has received $3.2 billion in funding from various investors including Sequoia group, BlackRock, Ant Capital, Soft Bank, Common Wealth Bank of Australia. In June 2021, Klarna raised $639 million in a fundraising round led by SoftBank Group's Vision Fund 2, taking the company's valuation to $45.6 billion.

## Business Activities:

Anyone shopping online at participating retailers can, at checkout, select the ‘Pay Later with Klarna’ option. This means that Klarna will actually pay for the goods upfront. 

Shoppers then put their card details in with Klarna and agree to pay for the goods either in full 30 days later or split the costs into three monthly payments (with the first paid as soon as the item is shipped).

The two most popular options — paying in 30 days, or paying in three instalments — are always interest-free. But there is also a longer-term financing option that allows users to spread the costs of big purchases over a maximum of 36 months at an interest rate of up to 18.9%.
